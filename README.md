Language Detection Overview
Language detection is the process of identifying the language of a given piece of text. This task is crucial in various applications, such as text translation, sentiment analysis, and localization. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how language detection works and how to implement it using Python with a demo dataset.

Steps for Language Detection
Understanding the Data:

This dataset has two columns: Text and language.
The Text column contains text snippets in different languages.
The language column provides the language labels for reference (ground truth).
Objective:

The goal is to use a language detection tool or library to predict the language of each text snippet and compare it with the actual language.
